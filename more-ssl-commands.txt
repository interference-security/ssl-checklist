Below commands are for a list of IP:Port as an input file:

For SSL certificate validity dates:
for data in `cat input_filename.txt`; do echo "$data:"; echo | openssl s_client -connect $data 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates; done

For SSL certificate issuer:
for data in `cat input_filename.txt`; do echo "$data:"; echo | openssl s_client -connect $data 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer; done

For SSL certificate issued to:
for data in `cat input_filename.txt`; do echo "$data:"; echo | openssl s_client -connect $data 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject; done

For SSL certificate fingerprint:
for data in `cat input_filename.txt`; do echo "$data:"; echo | openssl s_client -connect $data 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint; done

For complete SSL information provided by the host:port :
for data in `cat input_filename.txt`; do echo "$data:"; echo | openssl s_client -connect $data 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text; done



Below commands are for single IP:Port to test:

For SSL certificate validity dates:
echo | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

For SSL certificate issuer:
echo | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer

For SSL certificate issued to:
echo | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -subject

For SSL certificate fingerprint:
echo | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint

For complete SSL information provided by the host:port :
echo | openssl s_client -connect HOST:PORT 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text
